## Possible deliverables
* Rounded normal for grass blades?
* Dynamic Audio
    - Design dynamic POI-based audio system (current demo is just a hacky demo)
    - More stems play closer to POI, while volume is based off of angle?
* Performance Optimization 
    - instancing grass -> https://bevyengine.org/examples/Shaders/shader-instancing/
        *** 3/23 Bevy v13 has RenderAssetUsages. Explore this for grass that exists solely in Render world.
## Notes
* Queries
    - Queries cannot conflict -> Had the Camera controller query Transforms, as well as the Player controller, and it was not happy. Had to put camera logic in player logic.
        * UPDATE: Use Without filters. Bevy uses these to determine if there is possible overlap in queries.
* 2/21 Player deformation of grass
    - tried out deforming grass through player object emitting entities with GrassDeformation components and doing calculations to see if a grass vertex exists close to the GrassDeformation entity, to deform it.
    - Insights:
        * Spawning these entities constantly whenever moving is (expectedly) terrible for performance. A better approach would be to spawn only as points for a path
        * timer similar to projectile timer can be used to slowly un-deform the grass back to normal condition
* Use Bevy's ecs Added filter for one-time modifications
# Plugins: bevy doesn't like too many individual plugins added at a time. Group them instead.


CUSTOM GRASS SHADER NOTES:
* 3060 ti | Windows 10 | Before shader: Could handle 64x64=4096 grass blades per tile at 8x8=64 tiles = 262,144 blades of grass and only simulating wind on some of them
* 3060 ti | Windows 10 | After shader: Can handle 128x128=16384 grass blades per tile at 64 tiles = 1,048,576 million grass blades simulating wind! (^ these two were ~60fps targets)
* 9070XT | Linux Mint | Before frustum culling: 128x128=16384 grass blades per tile at 16x16=256 tile grass grid = 4,194,304 million grass blades at ~60 fps
* 9070XT | Linux Mint | After frustum culling ~120 fps, or increasing the size of the grass grid to see grass twice as far
