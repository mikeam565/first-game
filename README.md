# My first game in Rust using Bevy

This project serves as a tech demo for various subjects / algorithms in game dev I'm interested in.  
It's also a way to hone my Rust outside of work.  
My interests are terrain generation, AI, pathfinding, etc.  

So far, I've been working on implementing grass with wind. This was my progress after two days.

Recently, I've added a color gradient to the grass, while also adding:
* bevy_rapier3d physics
* player movement
* camera control

The blog post for these changes is WIP, but code is already pushed!
