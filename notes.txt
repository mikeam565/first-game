## Short/Medium term
* Grass
    - Improve general lighting + normal mapping of grass (rounded normal)
    - Improve the general API around grass
    - Further grass ideas: cover a terrain with grass, better shadows (base of grass has hard edge, I think this feature would be called occlusion?), etc.
    - Direct control of grass height vs grass scale factor
* Player object
    - movement + camera control
* Queries
    - Queries cannot conflict -> Had the Camera controller query Transforms, as well as the Player controller, and it was not happy. Had to put camera logic in player logic.
        * will need to build out design according to this limitation

## Longer term concerns
* Grass should have density reduced based on distance from player object
