# My first game in Rust using Bevy

This project serves as a tech demo for various subjects / algorithms in game dev I'm interested in.  
It's also a way to hone my Rust outside of work.  
My interests are terrain generation, AI, pathfinding, etc.  

Recently, I've added a color gradient to the grass, while also adding:
* bevy_rapier3d physics
* player movement
* camera control
